# INTRODUCTION
The study of stock prices is a complex one, but we are using innovative regression models and
multifractal analysis to gain a better understanding. Our approach is dynamic and driven by a
commitment to uncovering the financial intricacies that move markets.

Our journey commences with a meticulous examination of stock market dynamics, utilizing
formidable regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random
Forest. Through rigorous evaluation, scrutinizing metrics like R-squared, Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), a standout emerges—LSTM. With an
impressive R-squared score of 0.9, LSTM not only underscores its predictive prowess but also
solidifies its position as a key player in the nuanced landscape of stock market intricacies.
Expanding our analytical scope, we delve into the emerging frontier of multifractal analysis,
gaining prominence in our quest to understand financial time series and fractal behavior.
Leveraging log returns as a pivotal metric, our focus shifts to discern the inherent multifractal
nature embedded in stock prices. The revelation of multiple Hurst exponents, extracted through
the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Algorithm (MFDFA), proves to be instrumental in
unveiling the nuanced self-similarity and fractionality governed by diverse power scaling laws.
Our research stands as a substantial contribution to the ongoing discourse on market behavior,
establishing a symbiotic relationship between advanced regression models and multifractal
analysis. This synergy is paramount in unraveling the intricacies of the financial landscape. The
journey into the intricate randomness of stock price fluctuations is not merely a scientific
exploration; it is guided by an unwavering commitment to uncover the latent patterns shaping
the financial landscape.

Ultimately, our work serves as a valuable exploration, providing profound insights that
contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities inherent in financial markets. It is not
just about predicting stock prices; it is about decoding the underlying language of the market,
unveiling the hidden rhythms that governs the fluctuations of financial dynamics. This
comprehensive understanding enhances our ability to navigate the intricate randomness of
market movements, offering valuable perspectives for investors, analysts, and researchers alike.
Through this research journey, we illuminate the pathways to a more informed and insightful
engagement with the ever-shifting dynamics of financial markets.

# METHODOLOGY  
  
•	Data Collection: 
Our methodology initiates with the meticulous curation of a robust dataset, a fundamental cornerstone for our comprehensive analysis. We sourced daily closing prices for all sectors' indices on the Bombay Stock Exchange (S&P BSE) from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2009. Leveraging web scraping techniques, we directly extracted this invaluable financial data from Yahoo Finance. A stringent selection criterion was applied, focusing on the 16 sectors with complete and uninterrupted data throughout the specified timeframe. This approach ensures data integrity, reliability, and a holistic representation of market dynamics. 
 
•	Regression Modeling: 
Our exploration delves into diverse regression models, each offering unique insights into stock price behaviors. Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest are meticulously employed.  

•	R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination):
